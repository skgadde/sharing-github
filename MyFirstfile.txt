Git and GitHub 
Differences
Git is the Version Control Software.
It is the system to keep track of the history of the project we work on.
It has the special role in advanced and sophisticated features for Collaboration. 
Git Hub is the Webservice Interface where we can work on projects.
In this interface I can make the changes and save them(Commit).
I can review the history for each of my work which has a unique identifier with numbers and strings.
